    "text": "Welcome to the iBUG LAB in the University of Minnesota Department of Entomology. We’re a research group dedicated to understanding how insects are impacted by human changes to our environment. Our work focuses primarily on changes in land-use due to agriculture and shifts in climate and extreme weather in working landscapes using a variety of research approaches, but we specialize in using ecoinformatics and cross-scale experimental methods to examine insect responses from behaviors to communities. We work hard to find creative ways to apply our findings to develop targeted mitigation and conservation strategies to support insect biodiversity and the outsized ecological roles these small critters play in our landscapes."

Inset graphs (b and d) depict the general trend of these variables for each state in the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the temporal trend in predicted bumble bee occurrence across the six focal species (a–f). We use the species‐specific models which predict the probability of occurrence given cropland proportion and number of crops (with all interactions) to plot the expected county‐level probability for each census year of the model. With this information, for each species, we estimated a county‐level time series (GAM‐fits, black lines) as well as an overall trend in the predicted probability of occurrence (red lines) for the species. For each county and species, we use the average slope (i.e. temporal change) to create a spatial representation of the trend in predicted species occurrence given local agricultural conditions, where yellow, gold, and black indicate increasing, stable, and decreasing probability of occurrence over time respectively. Together, these panels depict the long‐term occurrence trend of each species as predicted by the agricultural intensification metrics (cropland proportion and number of crops), smoothing over short‐term fluctuations in predicted occurrence for in any single census year."

    "text": "Agricultural intensification is a key suspect among putative drivers of recent insect declines, but an explicit link between historical change in agricultural land cover and insect occurrence is lacking. Determining whether agriculture impacts beneficial insects (e.g. pollinators), is crucial to enhancing agricultural sustainability. Here, we combine large spatiotemporal sets of historical bumble bee and agricultural records to show that increasing cropland extent and decreasing crop richness were associated with declines in over 50% of bumble bee species in the agriculturally intensive Midwest, USA. Critically, we found that high crop diversity was associated with a higher occurrence of many species pre‐1950 even in agriculturally dominated areas, but that current agricultural landscapes are devoid of high crop diversity. Our findings suggest that insect conservation and agricultural production may be compatible, with increasing on‐farm and landscape‐level crop diversity predicted to have positive effects on bumble bees. Agricultural intensification is a key suspect among putative drivers of recent insect declines, but an explicit link between historical change in agricultural land cover and insect occurrence is lacking. Here, we find that historical patterns of agricultural intensification are strongly related to patterns in bumble bee species occurrence, specifically a loss in crop species richness and increased cropland proportion."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A rapidly warming climate is driving changes in biodiversity worldwide, and its impact on insect communities is critical given their outsized role in ecosystem function and services. We use a long‐term dataset of North American bumble bee species occurrences to determine whether the community temperature index (CTI), a measure of the balance of warm‐ and cool‐adapted species in a community, has increased given warming temperatures. CTI has increased by an average of 0.99°C in strong association with warming maximum summer temperatures over the last 30 years with the areas exhibiting the largest increases including mid‐ to high latitudes as well as low and high elevations—areas relatively shielded from other intensive global changes. CTI shifts have been driven by the decline of cold‐adapted species and increases in warm‐adapted species within bumble bee communities. Our results show the pervasive impacts and ecological implications warming temperatures pose to insects. An increase in maximum summer temperatures is strongly associated with shifting bumble bee community composition, with communities becoming increasingly dominated by warm‐adapted species, while cool‐adapted bumble bee species are declining across North America. However, north of the 50th parallel, both warm and cool‐adapted species are failing to keep pace with the rate of warming."

Plant‐pollinator mutualisms are vulnerable due to interacting effects of extreme heat on insect pollinator foraging behaviour and their forage plants. We designed an experiment to parse the impact of extreme heat on bumblebee foraging mediated directly through air temperature and indirectly through changes in plant rewards. Temperatures simulating a moderate heatwave negatively impacted foraging bumblebees reducing the proportion of successful foraging bouts, foraging bout duration and plant and flower visitation and indirect stress through reduced nectar production that limited foraging bout duration.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Agricultural practices and intensification over the past two centuries have dramatically altered the abundance and temporal continuity of floral resources that support pollinating insects such as bumble bees. Long‐term trends among bumble bees within agricultural regions suggest that intensive agricultural conditions have created inhospitable conditions for some species, while other species have maintained their relative abundances despite landscape‐level changes in flower availability. Bumble bee responses to spatiotemporal resource heterogeneity have been explored at the colony and behavioral level, but we have yet to understand whether these conditions drive community structure and ultimately explain the diverging patterns in long‐term species trends. To explore the relationship between landscape‐level floral resource continuity and the likelihood of bumble bee occurrence, we mapped the relative spatial and temporal availability of floral resources within an intensive agricultural region in the US Upper Midwest and related this resource availability with bumble bee species relative abundance. Across the bee community, we found that relative bumble bee occurrence increases in landscapes containing more abundant and more temporally continuous floral resources. Declining species, such as Bombus terricola, exhibited the strongest, positive responses to resource abundance and continuity whereas common, stable species, such as B. impatiens, showed no statistical relationship to either. Together with existing experimental evidence, this work suggests that efforts to increase spatiotemporal flower availability, along with overall flower abundance at landscape scales may have positive effects on bumble bee communities in the US Upper Midwest.

Given diverging long‐term trends in bumble bee occurrence, we hypothesized that species with declining populations (e.g., Bombus terricola, E) would be more sensitive to both resource abundance and temporal continuity, whereas stable species (e.g., Bombus impatiens, F) would respond mostly to resource abundance given their continued dominance in landscapes dominated by agriculture that exhibit low resource continuity."
