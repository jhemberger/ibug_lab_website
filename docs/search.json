    "text": "Welcome to the iBUG LAB in the University of Minnesota Department of Entomology. We’re a research group dedicated to understanding how insects are impacted by human changes to our environment. Our work focuses primarily on changes in land-use due to agriculture and shifts in climate and extreme weather in working landscapes using a variety of research approaches, but we specialize in using ecoinformatics and cross-scale experimental methods to examine insect responses from behaviors to communities. We work hard to find creative ways to apply our findings to develop targeted mitigation and conservation strategies to support insect biodiversity and the outsized ecological roles these small critters play in our landscapes."

We use the species‐specific models which predict the probability of occurrence given cropland proportion and number of crops (with all interactions) to plot the expected county‐level probability for each census year of the model. With this information, for each species, we estimated a county‐level time series (GAM‐fits, black lines) as well as an overall trend in the predicted probability of occurrence (red lines) for the species. For each county and species, we use the average slope (i.e. temporal change) to create a spatial representation of the trend in predicted species occurrence given local agricultural conditions, where yellow, gold, and black indicate increasing, stable, and decreasing probability of occurrence over time respectively. Together, these panels depict the long‐term occurrence trend of each species as predicted by the agricultural intensification metrics (cropland proportion and number of crops), smoothing over short‐term fluctuations in predicted occurrence for in any single census year."

Determining whether agriculture impacts beneficial insects (e.g. pollinators), is crucial to enhancing agricultural sustainability. Here, we combine large spatiotemporal sets of historical bumble bee and agricultural records to show that increasing cropland extent and decreasing crop richness were associated with declines in over 50% of bumble bee species in the agriculturally intensive Midwest, USA. Critically, we found that high crop diversity was associated with a higher occurrence of many species pre‐1950 even in agriculturally dominated areas, but that current agricultural landscapes are devoid of high crop diversity. Our findings suggest that insect conservation and agricultural production may be compatible, with increasing on‐farm and landscape‐level crop diversity predicted to have positive effects on bumble bees. Agricultural intensification is a key suspect among putative drivers of recent insect declines, but an explicit link between historical change in agricultural land cover and insect occurrence is lacking.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A rapidly warming climate is driving changes in biodiversity worldwide, and its impact on insect communities is critical given their outsized role in ecosystem function and services. We use a long‐term dataset of North American bumble bee species occurrences to determine whether the community temperature index (CTI), a measure of the balance of warm‐ and cool‐adapted species in a community, has increased given warming temperatures. CTI has increased by an average of 0.99°C in strong association with warming maximum summer temperatures over the last 30 years with the areas exhibiting the largest increases including mid‐ to high latitudes as well as low and high elevations—areas relatively shielded from other intensive global changes. CTI shifts have been driven by the decline of cold‐adapted species and increases in warm‐adapted species within bumble bee communities. Our results show the pervasive impacts and ecological implications warming temperatures pose to insects. An increase in maximum summer temperatures is strongly associated with shifting bumble bee community composition, with communities becoming increasingly dominated by warm‐adapted species, while cool‐adapted bumble bee species are declining across North America. However, north of the 50th parallel, both warm and cool‐adapted species are failing to keep pace with the rate of warming."

    "title": "Landscape‐scale floral resource discontinuity decreases bumble bee occurrence and alters community composition",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Agricultural practices and intensification over the past two centuries have dramatically altered the abundance and temporal continuity of floral resources that support pollinating insects such as bumble bees. Long‐term trends among bumble bees within agricultural regions suggest that intensive agricultural conditions have created inhospitable conditions for some species, while other species have maintained their relative abundances despite landscape‐level changes in flower availability. Bumble bee responses to spatiotemporal resource heterogeneity have been explored at the colony and behavioral level, but we have yet to understand whether these conditions drive community structure and ultimately explain the diverging patterns in long‐term species trends. To explore the relationship between landscape‐level floral resource continuity and the likelihood of bumble bee occurrence, we mapped the relative spatial and temporal availability of floral resources within an intensive agricultural region in the US Upper Midwest and related this resource availability with bumble bee species relative abundance. Across the bee community, we found that relative bumble bee occurrence increases in landscapes containing more abundant and more temporally continuous floral resources. Declining species, such as Bombus terricola, exhibited the strongest, positive responses to resource abundance and continuity whereas common, stable species, such as B. impatiens, showed no statistical relationship to either. Together with existing experimental evidence, this work suggests that efforts to increase spatiotemporal flower availability, along with overall flower abundance at landscape scales may have positive effects on bumble bee communities in the US Upper Midwest.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Agricultural practices and intensification over the past two centuries have dramatically altered the abundance and temporal continuity of floral resources that support pollinating insects such as bumble bees. Long‐term trends among bumble bees within agricultural regions suggest that intensive agricultural conditions have created inhospitable conditions for some species, while other species have maintained their relative abundances despite landscape‐level changes in flower availability. Bumble bee responses to spatiotemporal resource heterogeneity have been explored at the colony and behavioral level, but we have yet to understand whether these conditions drive community structure and ultimately explain the diverging patterns in long‐term species trends. To explore the relationship between landscape‐level floral resource continuity and the likelihood of bumble bee occurrence, we mapped the relative spatial and temporal availability of floral resources within an intensive agricultural region in the US Upper Midwest and related this resource availability with bumble bee species relative abundance. Across the bee community, we found that relative bumble bee occurrence increases in landscapes containing more abundant and more temporally continuous floral resources. Declining species, such as Bombus terricola, exhibited the strongest, positive responses to resource abundance and continuity whereas common, stable species, such as B. impatiens, showed no statistical relationship to either. Together with existing experimental evidence, this work suggests that efforts to increase spatiotemporal flower availability, along with overall flower abundance at landscape scales may have positive effects on bumble bee communities in the US Upper Midwest.

Four scenarios are depicted, describing temporally discontinuous resources at low (A) and high (B) abundance, and temporally continuous resources at low (C) and high (D) abundance. Given diverging long‐term trends in bumble bee occurrence, we hypothesized that species with declining populations (e.g., Bombus terricola, E) would be more sensitive to both resource abundance and temporal continuity, whereas stable species (e.g., Bombus impatiens, F) would respond mostly to resource abundance given their continued dominance in landscapes dominated by agriculture that exhibit low resource continuity."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Wild insects provide essential ecosystem services, including pollination, in both wild and managed landscapes. Over the past century, agricultural intensification and habitat loss have affected the amount and temporal availability of floral resources in the landscape—resources that all pollinating insects depend on. A reduction in the abundance and temporal continuity (i.e., gaps/bottlenecks in resources) of resources, for example, is associated with decreased occurrence of several bumble bee species within agricultural landscapes in Wisconsin. This has the potential to decrease the supply of pollination services to a variety of economically important crops. We inventoried the supply and demand of pollinators and pollinator dependent crops in a major fruit and vegetable production area in Wisconsin. We applied a model to predict the occurrence of wild bumble bees as a function of landscape-scale resource abundance and continuity as an index of pollinator “supply” and combined this with spatially-explicit data on pollinator-dependent crop production to identify areas of high pollination “demand”. In an important fruit producing area of central Wisconsin, we found a clear spatial mismatch between pollinator supply and pollination demand, with nearly 70% of landscapes with 15 or more hectares of pollinator dependent crops (e.g., cranberries, squash) exhibiting a lower bumble bee supply index relative to the intensity of crop demand. We found the source of this mismatch was largely due inadequate floral resource conditions for bumble bees, particularly due to high levels of resource discontinuity observed in the most agriculturally intensive landscapes (which also had the greatest pollination demands). Our results suggest that measures to increase crop diversity, reduce the size of fields, and focus on conserving and improving semi-natural habitat in the landscapes surrounding crop fields may support improved floral resource conditions. Such changes could ultimately bolster bumble bee populations, help stabilize the supply of pollination services, and improve the sustainability and economic stability of Wisconsin’s agricultural landscapes."

We found that colonies in Phacelia landscapes grew faster, had gained more mass, and produced more gynes than did colonies in reference landscapes with no Phacelia. Comparing colony responses between pulsed and continuous flowering resources showed that total mass gain at the end of the experiment was greater with continuous flowering resources. In contrast, colony growth rate and total gyne production were comparable for colonies adjacent to Phacelia plantings that were continuous versus pulsed. While low in statistical replication, given the scale of the experimental manipulation, our experiment shows that although B. impatiens colonies can exploit periods of resource discontinuity and gain mass, these continuously available floral resources appear important for colony growth and benefit gyne production. Landscape supplementation of floral resources reveals that continuously available floral resources provide a greater benefit to bumble bee colony performance (colony mass, gyne production, foraging activity) relative to discontinuous resource availability."

Highly variable populations, a limited pool of taxonomic expertise, and the simple logistical and financial challenges of conducting repeated, standardized surveys using people power each contribute to this challenge. To address this, we have been helping lead the development of affordable, autonomous camera-based monitoring systems using computer vision algorithms to automate data processing that can be deployed to address a range of research and monitoring questions. So far, we have been using these systems to understand how climate and agricultural drivers are together interacting to impact insect community activity and plant-pollinator interactions, quantify the impact of heat waves on pollinator visitation, and develop non-lethal tools for long-term monitoring of bumble bee biodiversity."

    "text": "Emergent climate-resilience mechanisms across scales of biological organization\nWe’re only beginning to understand the impact of a rapidly shifting climate on insect biodiversity and the ecological functions insects support. Most work thus far is limited to experimental lab methods to evaluate how environmental change (e.g., extreme heat) will impact insect behavior and reproduction. However, when we observe insects in more natural experimental and observational settings, emergent behaviors and community properties might temper the effect of environmental change, particularly within healthy landscapes. We’re exploring this concept, predicting that resilience (that is, the capacity of an ecological system to deal with change and continue to develop) increases with increasing scale of biological organization and ecological complexity. Doing this work will allow us to better predict the consequences of climate change on the services and disservices that insects provide in agricultural landscapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResilience to climatic stress (e.g., heat waves) may be an emergent property of ecological systems, increasing with added levels of exprimental realism/biological complexity."

I have worn a bunch of hats in my research career, working on topics ranging from insect foraging behavior to continental-scale analyses of shifts in community composition. I’m just as excited about big, creative experiments as I am about using existing data and some R sorcery to uncover cool new patterns. My work has largely used bumble bees as a model system, and a lot of my work still focuses on bumble and other wild bees. I have a special interest for understanding, promoting, and managing insects in agricultural landscapes.\nOutside of work, I’m keen to stay active and enjoy playing hockey, running, riding all of the bikes, and have been climbing for almost 20 years. I have a daughter named Fiadh (“Fee-ah”), a wife named Megan, and a menagerie of animals including two dogs, two cats, and 6 chickens.

    "text": "The distribution and abundance of foraging resources are key determinants of animal habitat use and persistence. Decades of agricultural expansion and intensification, along with the introduction of exotic species, have dramatically altered resource distributions in space and time. The nature of contemporary landscapes requires new approaches to understand how mobile organisms utilize the resulting highly fragmented, heterogeneous resources. We used colonies of the native bumble bee (Bombus vosnesenskii) deployed among habitat types and a land use gradient to characterize how resource availability and use change as a function of landscape composition throughout the season in a diverse agricultural region of Northern California. We employ a novel probabilistic framework to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of bumble bee resource use in different habitats. Bumble bee resource preference (i.e., pollen foraging) and availability (i.e., flowering plant abundance) are driven by the composition of the surrounding landscape and the time of year. Bumble bees strongly preferred pollen from native plants, which was overrepresented in samples across the season relative to its estimated availability. Our probabilistic model framework also revealed a strong reliance on seminatural habitat in the landscape (e.g., oak savannahs, chapparal, and riparian corridors)—features that are increasingly rare in anthropogenically dominated landscapes. In fact, pollen resource use by colonies even in the most intensive landscapes was largely limited to interstitial habitat (e.g., field and road edges) despite available mass-flowering crops. Our results highlight the importance of mosaic landscapes (i.e., landscape heterogeneity) in allowing bumble bees to link resources through the season. The framework we develop also serves to enhance predictions of insect resource use within fragmented landscapes."

In landscapes containing low seminatural habitat, we expected workers of Bombus vosnesenskii to collect primarily exotic and crop pollen from marginal habitat/field edges and crop fields, respectively. In landscapes containing high seminatural habitat, we expected workers to collect primarily native pollen from within seminatural habitat features.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Combining spatial information on distance‐weighted flower abundance from surveys along with model‐predicted foraging probability given seminatural habitat amount reveals the probability of bumble bees foraging on different landscape elements at three representative sites across the gradient of seminatural habitat (columns) and study months (rows). Darker colors indicate a higher probability of Bombus vosnesenskii foraging in each pixel."

    "text": "Managing insect biodiversity in agroecosystems\nInsects are essential organisms across all terrestrial ecosystems but have an especially critical role in agricultural landscapes as supporters of crop production. At the same time, many insect species reduce crop yields and the tools employed to control these pest species are at-odds with supporting beneficial insect biodiversity. In addition, the practices and structure of our agricultural landscapes over the last century, while dramatically increasing yields and nutritional stability, have had significant, negative effects on the population of insects that support crop production. We’re developing new methods to reconcile conflicting insect management strategies in agricultural landscapes to better support insect biodiversity while also working to mitigate the impact of crop pests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing pollen collected by returning bees along with spatially extensive flower surveys to predict the spatial foraging patterns of bumble bees in various landscape contexts to determine which landscape elements bees use and to help understand pesticide risk exposure."
