Our work focuses primarily on how insects respond to changes in land-use due to agriculture and shifts in climate and extreme weather in working landscapes. We use a variety of research approaches, but we specialize in using ecoinformatics and cross-scale experimental methods to examine insect responses from behaviors to communities. We strive to make our science open and accessible and to excel at clear science communication. Below, you'll find a non-exhaustive list of our ongoing research areas.

## Climate and extreme weather as drivers of insect behavior, populations, and communities

## Managing insect biodiversity in agroecosystems

## Emergent climate-resilience mechanisms across scales of biological organization

## Novel tools for insect biodiversiy monitoring
